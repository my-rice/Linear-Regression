# Linear-Regression Project.
The purpose of this project is to use statistical techniques to determine the model from a sample of data. The assigned dataset contains a sample of 100 observations, each consisting of the determination of 7 continuous quantitative variables: a dependent variable Y and 6 regressors Xi.

- In the first part of the work, the tools of descriptive statistics are used to expose the dataset and subsequently analyse the correlation between the variables. (Chapter 1) <br>
 - On the basis of what was observed during the previous phase, we then proceed to find a linear regression model describing the development of the dependent variable Y as a function of the regressors X1, ..., X6. (Chapter 2 and 3)
